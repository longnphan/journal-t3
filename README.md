## Introduction

I wanted to learn Next.js and Prisma, so I decided to give the T3 stack a try. I rebuilt the journal functionality of a project that I had previously built using the MERN stack to compare the differences between the two stacks, https://github.com/longnphan/journaljournal . I used JSON Web Tokens on the MERN stack version and it was a nice change of pace to use NextAuth.js to allow users to be able to log into this app with their GitHub account. So far, the T3 stack has been easier to work with and I look forward to using it in future projects.
